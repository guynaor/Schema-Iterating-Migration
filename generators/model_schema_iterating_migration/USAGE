    This generates a migration file for multi-tenant/multi-schema based application.
    Use this generator insstead of the usual script/generate model MyModelName field1:string field2:integer.
    The migration file will be created in db/migrate/schema_iterating_migration instead of the usual db/migrate.

Example:
    ./script/generate model_schema_iterating_migration User username:string

    This will create:
		db/migrate/schema_iterating_migration/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX_create_users.rb
